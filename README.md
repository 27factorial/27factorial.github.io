# About
Hey! This is a GitHub page that I'll be using to write about projects that I'm either currently
working on or that I want to make in the future. I created this repository so that I could actually
have motivation to finish projects instead of abandoning them and picking a new one up. If there's a
chance someone might actually see my work, I might as well make sure it's actually worth checking 
out, right?

Most of my projects are written in Rust, not because I believe it is "better" than any other
language per se, but simply because it's the one I have the most experience with and the one
I am most comfortable writing code in. For those interested, the software used to generate these 
pages is called [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), which I'm using because it allows me
to write without having to think about making the site look good.

Entries on this site are listed in reverse chronological order, meaning that newer posts/entries
will be listed above older ones.
